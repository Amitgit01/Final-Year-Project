# Final-Year-Project
EXPLORING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE ACROSS VARIED IOT DATA DOMAINS

This project explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in analyzing the vast amounts of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT). With IoT applications expanding across sectors like healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, and manufacturing, efficient data processing and analysis are crucial for unlocking valuable insights.  

The study evaluates the performance of six widely-used machine learning algorithms for classification tasks across three IoT-related datasets. Key performance metrics—precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and execution time—are used to benchmark these algorithms. The results highlight Random Forest as the most effective algorithm, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.  

By showcasing the optimization of IoT data analytics through the selection of suitable ML models, this research underscores the potential of AI/ML integration to advance IoT applications and improve decision-making processes across various domains.
